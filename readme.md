Book Flagger
===================

A script written in order to compare two very specific XLSX files, and to export them and manage the file system.


Installation Instructions
===================

1. Download and install Python from one of the following locations:
PC: http://ninite.com/python
Mac: http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.5/python-2.7.5-macosx10.6.dmg
The most important thing is to make sure you're using 2.7.5!!!
2. Download this git by clicking `download as .zip` over on the right.
3. Extract the program and save it in its own folder somewhere safe (for example, in your Documents folder or on your desktop).

Usage Instructions
===================

1. Make sure that you have both files (24x7 and Safari) in the Source Files folder. In addition, make sure that they are both `.xlsx`.
2. Open the file `BookFlaggeralpha.py` in IDLE. Do not just double click on the .py file.
3. Once the file is open in IDLE, click on `Run > Run Module` to run the program.
4. Follow the prompts. It will ask you to identify which file is the 24x7 file first, then the Safari file.
5. Once it is finished, it will report the number of matching records, then export those records to an `.xlsx` file in the `Results` folder. Copies of the files used will be stored in the `Archive` folder.
6. The program will then ask you if you would like it to clean up the files in the `Source Files` directory. Make your selection, then press `Enter`.
